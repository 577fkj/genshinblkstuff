# blkstuff
A unfinished (for now) .blk decryptor for Genshin Impact that doesn't require hooking into the game. Tested working as of 2.0.

While this program decrypts the .blk file, it doesn't handle extracting from the mhy0 file stored within. Because of that, it's not quite ready for the general public to get any use out of it yet.  I'll might work on it eventually, but this repo is up in case I never get around to working on it any more.
